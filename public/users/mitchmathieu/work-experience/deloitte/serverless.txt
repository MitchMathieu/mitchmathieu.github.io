I have written and maintained many serverless applications in Microsoft Azure using .NET and C#. Serverless functions allow you to execute code only when it is required, thus saving resources that would normally be used to keep an applicaiton running 24/7. These functions may be scaled up or down to meet variable demand.

I Have experience writing functions, unit tests, maintaining them with git, deploying them via pipelines in Azure DevOps, and observing them in production environments.
