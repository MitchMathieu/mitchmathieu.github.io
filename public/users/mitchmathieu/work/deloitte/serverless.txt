I have written and maintained many serverless applications in Microsoft Azure using .NET and C#. Serverless functions allow you to execute code only when required, thus saving resources that would normally be used to keep an application running 24/7. These functions may be scaled up or down to meet variable demand.

I have experience writing functions and unit tests, maintaining them with git, deploying them via pipelines in Azure DevOps, and observing them in production environments.
