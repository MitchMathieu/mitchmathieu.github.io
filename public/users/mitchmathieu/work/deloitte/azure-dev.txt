In my current role at Deloitte, I am an Azure developer focused on deploying event-driven, serverless solutions to the cloud. I help manage our client’s integration layer, managing and responding to incidents, performing enhancements to existing processes, and building new functionality.
Some of my accomplishments in this role include improving the client’s product update process, which resulted in weekly savings of $50,000, and developing an automated process for handling a frequent business error, saving our team work hours each week.
