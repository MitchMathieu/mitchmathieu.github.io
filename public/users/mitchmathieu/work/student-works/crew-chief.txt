During my second summer with Student Works, I moved up to crew chief. In this role, I was still expected to paint, but I was now responsible for 2-3 other painters as well. I ensured that we all arrived at the job sites on time and delivered an exceptional quality of work. I also managed client expectations and ensured that projects were finished within the budgeted time.
