In the summer of 2019, I worked as a Software developer at Dialogic, an enterprise networking and cloud solutions company. I was part of an internal incubation team focused on starting and building new products related to IoT and business communication tools. I built microservice integrations using Java and the Spring Boot framework, an out-of-office alert feature for the messaging app using Kotlin, simulated IoT data for demonstrations using Python, and more.
