During my last two years of school, I worked part-time as an Educator at Lululemon. I assisted guests throughout their journey in the store, from when they entered the door to when they left. I learned about every material we used to craft our products and how each material contributed to its functionality. I made our guests feel welcome and helped them make informed decisions.
