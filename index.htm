	<p class="blurb">Welcome! My name is Mitch and I am a computer science student at Queen's University expecting to graduate in May of 2020. I am hardworking, passionate about learning and I love to challenge myself to try new things and expand my skills which is exactly what this website is going to be about! I envision this being a place where I can share what I've been working on - both in my personal time and in school. I will keep it updated and consistently add more content as I keep learning :)</p>
